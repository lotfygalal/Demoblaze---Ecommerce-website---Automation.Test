# 📱 Nethar | App Testing (Android & iOS)

### 🧩 Overview
This project highlights **manual testing efforts** performed on the **Nethar mobile application (Android & iOS)** during its Beta phase.  
Working closely within the QA team, we executed **end-to-end testing** including **UI/UX validation, regression, performance, and defect reporting**.  
Our testing ensured stability and usability across multiple builds while maintaining **continuous feedback loops** between QA, development, and product teams for rapid issue resolution.  
The project reflects a **real-world mobile testing cycle** combining detailed documentation, structured defect reports, and collaborative review sessions.
